            <p>
                As someone with a music degree, I did not have too many options after graduation. After many years of 
                working in various jobs, I found coding. At the beginning of 2022 I started a Python certificate that I completed by the end of March.
                That program showed me a new passion for coding and using very logical thinking. Since then I have been trying to break into the tech world.
                Now I am in the process of a completing a web deveopment bootcamp, where I can hone in my computing knowledge, add new languages to my arsenal,
                and create a professional portfolio.
